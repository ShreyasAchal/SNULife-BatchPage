This folder contains the DBMS project documentation for the Student Academic Portal, including the IEEE-format report, ER model, and relational schema. It outlines the database's initial design and system implementation used in the project. 
Originally conceptualized as a course project, this initiative has since grown into an active collaboration with the universityâ€™s Academic Affairs Committee. The goal is to scale the system for institutional use across all batches, establishing a centralized academic management platform at the university level.
